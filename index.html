        <section id="Background">
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>Soccer, for many of us, is not merely a sport; it's a passion deeply ingrained since childhood. From the exhilarating matches on the field to the virtual battles in FIFA on PlayStations, our love for soccer has been a constant companion throughout our lives. It's this profound connection to the beautiful game that fuels our enthusiasm for delving into its intricacies through data analysis. 
                As avid players and followers of soccer, we've often found ourselves immersed in debates over player positions and roles. With questions arising like What attributes contribute to a player's overall rating? Why is the overall rating crucial for determining a player's impact on the field? During the late-night FIFA battles with friends, sometimes experimenting with unconventional players led to surprising outcomes, unveiling the strategic nuances of the game. 
                Driven by this curiosity and with the European Soccer database, we saw an opportunity to put into application the learnings of CMSC320 class. In this research endeavor, we aim to predict the overall rating of a soccer player, leveraging the player-attributes encapsulated in the dataset, thus shedding light on the intricate dynamics of player roles in soccer.</p>

        <h2>Data Curation</h2>
        <p>The dataset used for this research is the European Soccer Database, compiled by Mathien, Hugo. It is available on Kaggle and encompasses a comprehensive collection of soccer-related data. This dataset contains information on matches, players, teams, player attributes, and more from various European soccer leagues. The dataset provides a rich source of information for analyzing player positions and roles in soccer.</p>

        <h2>Data Processing</h2>
        <p>Data processing is a vital step in preparing the dataset for analysis. In our research, we begin by extracting relevant information from two key SQL tables: the "Player" table and the "Player Attributes" table. The "Player" table provides essential details such as player names, unique IDs, birthdays, and physical attributes like height and weight. On the other hand, the "Player Attributes" table contains specific performance ratings for various attributes, crucial for our analysis in predicting player positions. 
            To streamline our dataset, we merge the datasets of these two tables using the merge function from the pandas library, enabling us to combine pertinent information about each player into a single coherent dataset. Following the merge, we embark on basic data cleaning procedures. This involves removing redundant columns, such as duplicate entries for the same player, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. 
            Additionally, we calculate player ages from their birthdates, a more actionable metric for our analysis. By processing the data in this manner, we lay a solid foundation for subsequent</p>

        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
        <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) serves as a crucial preliminary step, enabling researchers to delve into the intricacies of the dataset and uncover meaningful insights. Within the context of our investigation, the EDA phase was instrumental in examining various hypotheses regarding the factors influencing the overall rating of players within our dataset. 
            After playing around with multiple hypotheses each targeting distinct aspects of player attributes and their potential impact on overall performance ratings, we narrowed down to three main hypotheses given below.
        </p>
        <section id="hyp1">
            <h3>Hypothesis-1</h3>
            <p>Our first hypothesis is centered on the premise of athletic prowess, aiming to ascertain whether athleticism directly influences a player's overall rating. We combined multiple player attributes like 'acceleration', 'sprint_speed', 'agility', 'reactions', 'balance', 'jumping', 'stamina', and 'strength' to create the 'athleticism' attribute. 
             This hypothesis was formulated with a null hypothesis (HO) suggesting no direct influence, countered by an alternative hypothesis (HA) positing the opposite. 
             Based on the very low p-value we concluded that 'athleticism' has an influence on the overall rating of a player.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="hyp2">
            <h3>Hypothesis-2</h3>
            <p>Our next hypothesis delved into the relationship between a player's foot preference and their overall rating. Here, the null hypothesis (HO) posited no significant effect of foot preference on overall rating, contrasting with the alternative hypothesis (HA) proposing a notable influence. 
                Our p-value for this hypothesis was very high suggesting that foot preference has no significant effect on the overall rating on a player.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="hyp3">
            <h3>Hypothesis-3</h3>
            <p>Our last hypothesis ventured into the combined effects of age, height, and weight on a player's overall rating. Within this hypothesis, the null hypothesis (HO) suggested a collective impact of these variables on the overall rating, while the alternative hypothesis (HA) contested such an effect. 
                With a very-low p-value we rejected the null hypothesis and moved forward with the alternative hypothesis which says that age, height and weight do not affect the overall rating of a player.
