# CMSC320 Group Final Project

## Project Title: "Rating Fusion: A Predictive Model for Soccer Player Performance"

### Overview:
Soccer, for many of us, is not merely a sport; it's a passion deeply ingrained since childhood. From the exhilarating matches on the field to the virtual battles in FIFA on PlayStations, our love for soccer has been a constant companion throughout our lives. It's this profound connection to the beautiful game that fuels our enthusiasm for delving into its intricacies through data analysis. 
As avid players and followers of soccer, we've often found ourselves immersed in debates over player positions and roles. With questions arising like What attributes contribute to a player's overall rating? Why is the overall rating crucial for determining a player's impact on the field? During the late-night FIFA battles with friends, sometimes experimenting with unconventional players led to surprising outcomes, unveiling the strategic nuances of the game. 
Driven by this curiosity and with the European Soccer database, we saw an opportunity to put into application the learnings of CMSC320 class. In this research endeavor, we aim to predict the overall rating of a soccer player, leveraging the player-attributes encapsulated in the dataset, thus shedding light on the intricate dynamics of player roles in soccer.
